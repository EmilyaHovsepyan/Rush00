> First group project at 42 School â€” an introduction to teamwork, Git, and basic C programming.  
> The goal is to build a program that prints different borders made of ASCII characters, forming rectangles.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Rush 00 is a weekend project where students collaborate to create a C program that prints rectangles of varying sizes using different border styles. The project focuses on teamwork, clean code, and mastering basics like loops, conditionals, and output functions.

## ðŸ§± How It Works

The program takes two arguments: width (`x`) and height (`y`), and outputs a rectangle pattern made of characters:

Example for `rush00(5, 3)`:
o---o
|   |
o---o

Each "rush" variation has a different border style:
- `rush00`: uses `o`, `-`, and `|`

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Build

```bash
gcc rush00.c -o rush00
